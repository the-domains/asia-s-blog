<article style=""><h1>#13bitBuilder #TFNY "Create-a-Character" Contest Winners Announced!</h1><p>Hello Builders! We're thrilled to announce the winners for the #TFNY Create-a-Character Contest! We were blown away by all the cool characters you all created. Everyone did a fantastic job. We have tallied the likes and conducted our secret internal vote and decided upon our four favorites to be featured on our t-shirts during Toy Fair New York, February 13th to 16th.</p><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/55e50bdfe4b0a8e8abf3e82c/55e50f4ae4b031d6526fa03d/56afb65b2eeb817dd8c61bcc/1455905870623/?format=1000w" /></article>
